# -An-automated-smart-irrigation-system-designed-to-prevent-water-waste-
This project implements an automated smart irrigation system designed to prevent water waste, based on an ESP32 board and integrating several sensors: soil moisture, temperature, air humidity, and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in the reservoir. The system operates in two modes: a manual mode, where the user can remotely activate the pump via the Blynk application, and an automatic mode, where watering is triggered based on various environmental conditions (dry soil, high temperature, low air humidity, and sufficient water level). The more critical the conditions, the longer the watering duration; conversely, if the environmental factors are moderate, the watering duration is shorter. All sensor data is displayed in real-time on the Blynk app, which also allows controlling the pump and indicating system status through LEDs.
